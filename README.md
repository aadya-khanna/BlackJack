## 🎴 Blackjack — A Tiny, Playful JS Simulator

A quick and simple **Blackjack simulator** I built to learn the basics of JavaScript.  
Built with **HTML**, **TailwindCSS**, and **pure JavaScript** for all the game logic.

*Minimal design*  
*Playful interactions*  
*Fast, no-frills gameplay*

After demoing to a few friends, they mentioned how we should actively be able to see dealer's hand. Will add this logic in the coming days!
